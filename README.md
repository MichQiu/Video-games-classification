Classifying whether video games are paid or free. This is based on a range of features such as DLC counts, Metacritic scores, platform dependcies etc. The data is sourced from SteamSpy.

Several models have been used on this problem which include logsitic regression, support vector classifier, decision tree classifier, XGBoost classifier and also a voting classifier. Final accuracy score should lie around 97%.

Preprocessing, feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization steps are detailed within the Script.py.
